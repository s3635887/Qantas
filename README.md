instructions to run the program

1. Download all the files. Keep them in the same folder.
2. In the terminal navigate to the files and type python3 flightinfoapi.py .( for windows users, just type python flightinfoapi.py)
3. Copy the ip generated in the terminal to the browser, paste it in a new tab and add /flights to the end of the ip address.
4. An alternate way to check if the api is working or not is to download postman. Install it. paste the ip+/flights in the url bar in the tool and make a get request.
